Only in the GET requests, when there a foreign key is involved there should be a nested object for example

the GET Request in modification 1.1 would change to:

    {
                "id":222,
                "supplier" : {
                    "id":3,
                    "name":"Patrick Wilson"
                },
                "issueDate" : "DD-MM-YY",
                "deliveryDate" : "DD-MM-YY",
                "items" : [
                    {
                        "id":45,
                        "foodItem": {
                        "id":139,
                        "name" : "Garam Masala"
                        },
                        "delivered":"Yes",
                        "quantityDemanded":34,
                        "rate":120       
                    },
                    {
                        "id":46,
                        "foodItem": {
                        "id":141,
                        "name" : "Bread"
                        },
                        "delivered":"No",
                        "quantityDemanded":32,
                        "rate":100       
                    }
                ]


        }
